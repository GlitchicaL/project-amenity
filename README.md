# project-amenity
A fake e-commerce furniture store built using HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), Javascript, and Python (Django).

This project is essentially one of my "programming playgrounds". This is where I began learning
about Django, Git and Github respositories, and experimenting with Bootstrap. I do plan to
eventually implement more Javascript and JS libraries as I learn them, and might deploy to 
Heroku in the future.
